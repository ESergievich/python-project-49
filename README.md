# Brain Games

"Brain Games" is an educational project within the Python Development course at [Hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io/my).
The project consists of 5 console games designed to develop thinking. Each game poses a question and expects the correct
answer. To win, you must give three correct answers in a row. An error suggests starting the game over.
